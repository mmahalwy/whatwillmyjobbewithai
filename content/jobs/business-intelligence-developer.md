## Why This Job Will Transform

BI developers traditionally build reports, dashboards, and data visualizations. AI tools can now generate visualizations from descriptions, create reports from data, and even suggest insights.

BI developers become BI Strategists who design organizational intelligence:

- **Information architecture**: Designing how data flows through the organization and reaches decision-makers
- **Tool strategy**: Selecting and integrating BI tools, including AI-powered analytics
- **Adoption and training**: Ensuring BI investments actually change how decisions are made
- **Metric definition**: Working with stakeholders to define what should be measured and why
- **Insight delivery design**: Creating systems that proactively surface important information

BI Strategists ensure organizations actually become data-driven, not just data-rich.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Learn about AI-powered analytics.** Tools like ThoughtSpot, Power BI Copilot, and Tableau AI are changing how users interact with data. Understanding these tools is essential.

**Develop change management skills.** BI success depends on adoption. Understanding how to drive organizational change is as important as technical skills.

**Master data storytelling.** The ability to create compelling narratives from data helps stakeholders understand and act on insights.

**Build stakeholder management skills.** Understanding different users' needs and tailoring solutions for each group maximizes BI impact.

**Learn about embedded analytics.** Analytics integrated into applications and workflows often have more impact than standalone dashboards.

**Understand performance optimization.** As data volumes grow, ensuring dashboards and reports remain responsive requires ongoing attention.
