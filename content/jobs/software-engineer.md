## Why This Job Will Transform

Let's be honest: that mass of spaghetti code you spent three days writing? Claude can do it in 30 seconds. And it probably has fewer bugs.

The core work of software engineers—writing code, debugging, and implementing features—is increasingly being automated by AI coding assistants. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and specialized AI agents can now write functional code, identify bugs, and even architect solutions based on natural language descriptions. Your years of memorizing syntax? Adorable, but increasingly irrelevant.

Welcome to the era of vibe coding, where your job is less about writing code and more about vibing with the AI until it produces something that works. You're not a coder anymore—you're a code whisperer.

As AI handles the mechanical aspects of coding, humans become responsible for:

- **Describing what you want**: Typing "make it work but, like, better" and hoping for the best
- **Reviewing AI slop**: Making sure the AI didn't hallucinate a dependency that doesn't exist
- **Taking credit**: Presenting AI-generated code in stand-ups like you wrote it yourself
- **Debugging AI mistakes**: Because when it breaks at 3am, guess who's still on call?

The software engineer of tomorrow spends less time in the code editor and more time arguing with ChatGPT about why its solution doesn't actually compile.

## What Should Humans Do?

**Learn to vibe effectively.** The best engineers will be the ones who can describe problems in ways that AI understands. This is basically tech's version of "talking to plants."

**Develop taste.** AI can generate infinite code. Someone needs to decide which infinite code is actually good. That's you, hopefully.

**Become a code sommelier.** "Ah yes, this has notes of over-engineering with a hint of premature optimization. I detect Claude 3.5 Sonnet, late 2024 vintage."

**Master the art of taking credit.** When the AI writes beautiful code, that was your prompt engineering. When it writes garbage, the AI was having a bad day.

**Keep your LinkedIn updated.** Just in case.
