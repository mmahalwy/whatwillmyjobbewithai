## Why This Job Will Transform

Senior developers have traditionally provided value through deep technical expertise and the ability to solve complex problems. While AI can now solve many technical problems, the judgment about which problems to solve and how they fit into broader systems remains human.

Senior developers become Technical Decision Makers who:

- **Set technical direction**: Making choices about architecture, technology, and approach that shape projects
- **Evaluate trade-offs**: Weighing competing concerns like speed, quality, cost, and maintainability
- **Mentor at scale**: Guiding junior developers and AI systems toward better outcomes
- **Navigate ambiguity**: Making sound decisions with incomplete information
- **Champion quality**: Ensuring AI-assisted development produces maintainable, secure code

Technical Decision Makers combine deep expertise with judgment, providing the human oversight that AI development requires.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop your judgment explicitly.** Document your decision-making process. When you make a technical choice, write down why. This builds the muscle for articulating trade-offs.

**Learn to evaluate AI output at scale.** Practice quickly assessing AI-generated code for security, performance, and correctness. This becomes a core skill as AI generates more code.

**Build mentoring capabilities.** Your ability to guide others—both humans and AI—becomes your primary leverage. Practice explaining concepts, giving feedback, and helping others grow.

**Cultivate domain expertise.** Deep knowledge of specific domains (payments, video streaming, ML infrastructure) remains valuable because it's hard to acquire and harder to automate.

**Stay hands-on strategically.** While you may write less code, maintaining the ability to dive deep when needed preserves your credibility and your ability to evaluate others' work.

**Develop organizational influence.** Technical Decision Makers need to advocate for their positions, build consensus, and navigate organizational dynamics. These soft skills become essential.
