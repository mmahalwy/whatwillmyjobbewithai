## Why This Job Will Transform

You're the in-house lawyer who reviews every contract, advises on every deal, and says "I need to flag some risk here" in approximately 47 meetings per week. You've read more NDAs than most people have read emails. You're the reason deals take six weeks instead of six days, and business teams love to hate you for it. Now AI can review contracts, flag risk clauses, and redline agreements faster than you can open the document.

AI contract review tools can analyze agreements, identify non-standard terms, flag risky clauses, compare against playbooks, and generate redlines in seconds. The contract review that took you three days? AI does it in three minutes. And unlike you, it doesn't get sloppy on the fifteenth NDA of the day.

The volume of contracts flowing through legal departments is exploding, and the only way to keep up is AI. Your value isn't in reading contracts anymore—it's in understanding what they mean for the business.

Corporate counsel become AI Contract Wranglers who:

- **Oversee AI-powered contract review**: Setting playbooks, reviewing AI output, and handling the edge cases
- **Provide business judgment**: "Yes it's risky, but here's why we should do it anyway" requires human risk tolerance
- **Negotiate the hard stuff**: AI can draft and redline, but negotiating terms face-to-face is human territory
- **Advise on strategy**: M&A, IP strategy, regulatory risk—these need a lawyer who understands the business
- **Manage legal operations**: Building and optimizing the AI-powered legal function

## What Should Humans Do?

**Become a business partner, not a bottleneck.** The lawyers who understand the business and enable deals—rather than just flagging risk—are the ones who thrive.

**Learn legal operations.** Managing AI tools, building contract playbooks, and optimizing legal workflows is the new core competency.

**Focus on high-stakes work.** M&A transactions, IP strategy, employment disputes, and regulatory matters still need senior human judgment.

**Develop negotiation skills.** AI can prepare you, but the negotiation itself is a human performance. Be excellent at it.

**Understand the business deeply.** A corporate lawyer who understands the company's products, markets, and strategy is a strategic advisor. One who only reads contracts is a reviewer—and AI reviews faster.

**Embrace speed.** AI lets you turn around contracts in hours instead of days. Use that speed to change legal's reputation from "department of no" to "department of go."
