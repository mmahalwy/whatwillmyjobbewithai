## Why This Job Will Transform

You bill $300/hour to make PowerPoint slides that tell executives what they already know, but in a fancier font with a 2x2 matrix. You've mastered the art of saying "it depends" while looking confident. Congratulations—AI can now generate those same slides, frameworks, and recommendations in seconds.

The classic consulting toolkit—market sizing, competitive analysis, benchmarking, process mapping, and the beloved "current state vs. future state" diagram—is being automated faster than you can say "let's align on the deliverables." AI can analyze more data, faster, and produce frameworks that look suspiciously like what McKinsey would charge $2M for.

Your ability to stay at a Marriott four nights a week? Still unmatched. Your ability to produce a 90-slide deck? Increasingly obsolete.

Management consultants become AI Slide Whisperers who:

- **Polish AI-generated decks**: Adding the "so what" that AI consistently misses
- **Work the room**: AI can make the slides, but someone needs to present them while maintaining eye contact
- **Navigate politics**: Figuring out what the client actually wants (which is rarely what they say they want)
- **Sell more work**: The real consulting skill was always sales, and that hasn't changed
- **Add credibility**: "McKinsey said so" still carries weight, even if McKinsey used AI to say it

## What Should Humans Do?

**Become the relationship, not the deliverable.** Clients hire consultants they trust, not consultants who make good slides. The slides are now free; the trust is not.

**Specialize in implementation.** Everyone knows what to do. The hard part is actually doing it. Consultants who can drive change, not just recommend it, are irreplaceable.

**Develop genuine industry expertise.** "I spent 15 years in healthcare" beats "I Googled healthcare trends" every time. Deep expertise is your moat against AI-generated insights.

**Learn to facilitate, not just present.** The most valuable consultants help clients think, not just hand them answers. AI gives answers. Humans ask the right questions.

**Get comfortable with smaller teams.** The 20-person consulting team doing data gathering is dead. The 3-person team with AI tools doing the same work? Very much alive.

**Accept that your frameworks aren't magic.** SWOT analysis, Porter's Five Forces, the BCG Matrix—AI knows them all. Your value isn't the framework; it's knowing which one actually applies.
