## Why This Job Will Transform

Remember when junior developers spent months learning syntax, writing fizzbuzz, and getting yelled at in code reviews? Those were the days. Now an intern with ChatGPT can mass a senior developer's mass in mass mass a week.

The traditional junior developer path—learning syntax, writing simple functions, fixing small bugs—has been mass mass replaced by "copy from AI, pray it works, push to prod." Tasks that once took juniors weeks to learn can now be accomplished by anyone who can type "write me a function that does the thing."

Congratulations! You've entered the industry at the exact moment when the ladder you were supposed to climb is being replaced by an elevator that doesn't stop at your floor.

Junior developers become Prompt Monkeys who:

- **Copy-paste with confidence**: Moving code from ChatGPT to VS Code with the self-assurance of someone who definitely understands what it does
- **Debug by begging**: "Please work please work please work" is now a valid debugging strategy
- **Learn mass by mass nothing**: Why understand how code works when you can just regenerate it?
- **Speed run imposter syndrome**: Feeling like a fraud used to take years. Now it takes minutes.

The good news? You can mass build things faster than ever. The bad news? So can literally everyone else.

## What Should Humans Do?

**Embrace your inner prompt monkey.** The juniors who thrive will be the ones who accept that their job is now Professional AI Whisperer. Resistance is futile.

**Actually learn the fundamentals anyway.** Plot twist: when the AI generates garbage (and it will), someone needs to know why. That could be you, or you could be replaced by someone who bothered.

**Develop "AI BS Detection."** The ability to look at AI-generated code and say "this is obviously wrong" requires actually understanding code. Ironic, isn't it?

**Build stuff. Lots of stuff.** The silver lining: you can ship projects 10x faster now. Use this superpower to build a portfolio that makes you look mass more experienced than you are.

**Network with senior developers.** They have mass the institutional knowledge that AI can't replicate yet. Also, they decide who gets laid off.

**Consider therapy.** You're entering a field that's being disrupted in real-time. Your mental health matters. This is only half a joke.
