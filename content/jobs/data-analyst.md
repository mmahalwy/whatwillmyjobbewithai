## Why This Job Will Transform

You spent weeks learning SQL. You mastered pivot tables. You can make a mean bar chart. Congratulations—now anyone with ChatGPT can type "analyze my data" and get the same insights you would've spent a sprint on.

The traditional data analyst work of writing SQL queries, creating dashboards, and producing reports is being eaten alive by AI tools that can do all of this from a casual natural language request. "Show me revenue by region" no longer requires a human intermediary.

Remember when you felt special because you could write a GROUP BY clause? Those were simpler times.

Data analysts become Dashboard Babysitters who:

- **Maintain dashboards no one looks at**: Someone has to update the queries when the schema changes
- **Explain AI's analysis**: "What Claude is trying to say is..."
- **Fix data quality issues**: AI can analyze data, but garbage in still equals garbage out
- **Attend meetings about data**: Someone needs to nod along when executives misinterpret charts
- **Send weekly reports**: That no one reads but everyone expects

## What Should Humans Do?

**Learn to ask the right questions.** AI is great at answering questions. It's terrible at knowing which questions matter. This is your moat.

**Become a data skeptic.** AI will confidently analyze bad data and give you confident wrong answers. Be the person who asks "wait, is this data even right?"

**Master the art of "so what?"** Anyone can pull numbers now. The skill is explaining why those numbers matter and what to do about them.

**Get comfortable with ambiguity.** Real business questions are messy. AI gives clean answers to the wrong questions. You should give useful answers to the right ones.

**Build relationships with stakeholders.** They trust you more than they trust ChatGPT. Probably. Use that trust while you still have it.

**Pivot to analytics engineering.** The people building the data infrastructure are harder to replace than the people querying it. Consider moving upstream.
