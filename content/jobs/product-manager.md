## Why This Job Will Transform

Product managers have spent years perfecting the art of saying "let's take this offline" and writing PRDs that no one reads. Now AI can write those PRDs too—and unlike human PMs, AI doesn't need a 30-minute meeting to discuss the meeting about the document.

The tactical PM work—writing specs, analyzing data, creating roadmaps, making Jira tickets—can now be done by AI in seconds. That beautiful PRD you spent three days on? Claude can generate it while you're still opening Google Docs.

So what's left? Vibes. Pure, unadulterated vibes.

Product managers become Chief Vibes Officers who:

- **Attend meetings**: Someone still needs to be in the room where it happens. That's you.
- **Say "great question"**: Buying time while AI generates your actual answer
- **Manage up**: Explaining to executives why the AI-generated roadmap is brilliant
- **Manage down**: Explaining to engineers why the AI-generated requirements make sense (even when they don't)
- **Own the narrative**: When things go well, it was your vision. When things fail, it was an AI hallucination.

The PM of tomorrow is less "mini-CEO" and more "professional meeting-haver with AI superpowers."

## What Should Humans Do?

**Lean into the vibes.** Your job is increasingly about alignment, buy-in, and "socializing ideas." These are fancy words for "making people feel good about decisions." Own it.

**Become an AI whisperer.** The PMs who can get AI to generate actually-good PRDs, roadmaps, and analyses will outperform those who can't. Prompt engineering is now a PM skill.

**Develop strong opinions, loosely held.** AI can generate infinite options. You need taste to pick the right one. This is the human value-add.

**Get really good at stakeholder management.** AI can't read the room in a tense executive meeting. You can (hopefully). This is your moat.

**Learn enough technical stuff to call BS.** When engineering says "that's technically impossible," you need to know if they mean it or if they just don't want to do it.

**Accept that everyone thinks they can do your job now.** They're partially right. Your job is to prove them partially wrong.
