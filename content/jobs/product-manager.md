## Why This Job Will Transform

Product managers coordinate features, write PRDs, analyze data, and manage stakeholders. AI can now draft PRDs, analyze user feedback, and even generate roadmaps. The tactical execution work is being automated.

Product managers become Product Strategists who:

- **Define product vision**: Creating compelling visions that inspire teams and guide decisions
- **Identify market opportunities**: Finding problems worth solving and markets worth entering
- **Make hard trade-offs**: Choosing what not to build, which is harder than choosing what to build
- **Build AI into products**: Understanding how AI capabilities can solve user problems
- **Orchestrate AI development**: Working with AI tools and human teams to ship products faster

Product Strategists spend less time on documentation and more time on the judgment calls that shape products.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop strategic thinking.** Practice frameworks like Porter's Five Forces, jobs-to-be-done, and competitive analysis. Strategy skills become more valuable as execution becomes faster.

**Learn about AI capabilities.** Understanding what AI can do helps you identify opportunities to build AI-powered products and features.

**Build customer intuition.** Deep understanding of customer problems, motivations, and behaviors is hard to automate. Invest in customer research and conversations.

**Master prioritization frameworks.** The ability to make and defend prioritization decisions becomes more important as teams can build more, faster.

**Develop financial acumen.** Understanding unit economics, business models, and financial metrics helps you build products that are both useful and profitable.

**Practice communicating vision.** Inspiring teams and stakeholders requires clear, compelling communication. This human skill becomes more important.
