## Why This Job Will Transform

You went to J-school because you believed in the power of the press, the importance of truth, and the romance of the newsroom. Then you discovered the pay. Now AI can write news articles, summarize press conferences, and generate "10 Things You Won't Believe About..." listicles faster than your editor can say "needs more SEO."

AI is already writing earnings reports, sports recaps, and weather summaries at major outlets. It can scan press releases, synthesize data, and produce serviceable copy at a pace that makes your fastest deadline seem glacial. The commodity news article—the who, what, when, where—is being automated.

But journalism was never really about writing fast recaps. It's about accountability, investigation, and telling the stories that powerful people don't want told. AI can't cultivate a source over years. AI can't knock on doors. AI can't sit in a courtroom for months covering a trial because something feels wrong.

The title stays because the mission stays:

- **Investigative work becomes the core**: The "just the facts" stuff is automated; the "what are they hiding?" stuff is not
- **Source relationships matter more**: Your contacts and their trust in you are irreplaceable
- **AI becomes your research assistant**: Analyzing documents, finding patterns in data, and surfacing leads
- **Verification is now the job**: In a world of AI-generated content, someone needs to confirm what's actually true
- **Voice and perspective are the product**: Generic reporting is free; your unique take is what people pay for

## What Should Humans Do?

**Invest in investigative skills.** The journalists who survive are the ones who uncover things, not the ones who rewrite press releases. Learn FOIA requests, data analysis, and source development.

**Develop a recognizable voice.** In a sea of AI-generated content, a distinctive human voice stands out. Be a writer people seek out, not a content producer who's interchangeable with a bot.

**Learn data journalism.** AI can process massive datasets. Pair that with journalistic judgment and you can find stories no one else can.

**Build direct audience relationships.** Newsletters, podcasts, social media—own your audience. Platform-dependent journalists are vulnerable. Audience-dependent journalists are not.

**Become the verification layer.** As AI-generated misinformation explodes, the demand for trusted, verified information increases. Be the person people trust to separate truth from noise.

**Don't chase AI's speed.** You'll lose that race. Compete on depth, accuracy, and stories that matter. The world needs journalists more than ever—just not the ones rewriting AP wire stories.
