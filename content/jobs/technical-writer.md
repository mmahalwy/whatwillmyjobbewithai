## Why This Job Will Transform

You've spent your career explaining complex things simply, turning developer gibberish into human-readable documentation. Now AI can do that too—and it doesn't need three meetings to understand the product.

Technical writers create documentation, user guides, and help content. AI can now generate all of this from code comments (when they exist), API schemas, and vague product descriptions. That README you spent a week perfecting? Claude can write something passable in 30 seconds.

The cruel irony: documentation was always undervalued, and now it's being automated. You were underpaid AND replaceable. Sorry.

Technical writers become Documentarians of the AI Apocalypse who:

- **Clean up AI docs**: Fixing hallucinated parameters and made-up features
- **Write docs that AI will read**: Your audience is increasingly other AI tools
- **Maintain the docs no one reads**: Someone has to update the changelog
- **Explain AI features to humans**: "What does this AI do?" is a whole new genre
- **Document the documentation process**: Meta-documentation is your new normal

## What Should Humans Do?

**Become an AI fact-checker.** AI documentation sounds confident even when completely wrong. You are the last line of defense against hallucinated API endpoints.

**Learn to write for AI audiences.** Increasingly, your docs are being consumed by AI tools (RAG, code assistants). Write in ways that AI can parse and retrieve effectively.

**Master the art of information architecture.** AI can write individual docs. It can't organize an entire knowledge base coherently. Yet.

**Develop "developer empathy."** Understanding what developers actually need (vs. what they say they need, vs. what AI thinks they need) remains a human skill.

**Specialize in complex domains.** Generic documentation is easy to automate. Docs for nuclear reactors, medical devices, or financial regulations? Less so.

**Accept the existential dread.** Your job was explaining things. AI explains things now. Find peace in being the editor, curator, and quality gate. It's not nothing.
