## Why This Job Will Transform

UX designers have spent years mastering Figma, memorizing Material Design guidelines, and arguing about whether that button should be 2 pixels to the left. Congratulations—AI can now generate 47 variations of that button in 3 seconds.

The tools you spent months learning? Figma has AI now. The wireframes you carefully craft? v0 can generate them from a text description. The user flows you meticulously document? Claude will make one while you're still opening your design file.

Your portfolio of 50 slightly-different mobile app designs? It's about to compete with AI that can generate 50 designs before your morning coffee.

UX designers become Professional AI Design Curators who:

- **Generate options**: "Make me 10 versions of this" is your new primary skill
- **Pick the least bad one**: Developing taste becomes your entire value proposition
- **Explain why it's good**: Post-hoc rationalization of AI-generated designs
- **Add the human touch**: Making tiny adjustments so you can say you "designed" it
- **Defend design decisions**: "The AI suggested this, and I agreed" doesn't fly in reviews

## What Should Humans Do?

**Develop taste.** Anyone can generate designs now. Few people can tell good from bad. Be the person with taste. This is genuinely rare and valuable.

**Learn to art direct AI.** Your job is less "designer" and more "creative director of AI tools." Learn to prompt effectively and iterate quickly.

**Get really good at user research.** AI can generate infinite designs but can't watch a user struggle with a confusing interface. The humans-being-confused-by-things pipeline remains un-automated.

**Master the dark arts of stakeholder management.** "I designed this" and "I directed the AI that designed this" feel very different in presentations. Learn to navigate this.

**Embrace accessibility.** AI-generated designs often ignore edge cases, accessibility requirements, and real-world constraints. Being the person who catches this keeps you employed.

**Consider becoming a design engineer.** If you can implement your own designs, you're harder to replace than someone who just pushes pixels (or prompts AI to push pixels).
