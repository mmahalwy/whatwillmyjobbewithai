## Why This Job Will Transform

You spent four years in med school, five years in residency, and possibly a fellowship, all to become really, really good at looking at images. You can spot a 3mm nodule on a CT scan that mere mortals would miss. Incredible—except AI can now detect those same nodules with accuracy that matches or exceeds yours, and it processes images in milliseconds instead of minutes.

Radiology has been the AI canary in the coal mine for years. "AI will replace radiologists" has been predicted since approximately 2016. It hasn't happened yet—but the job is transforming faster than any other medical specialty. AI can read chest X-rays, detect breast cancer on mammograms, identify strokes on CT scans, and flag abnormalities with superhuman consistency.

The key word is "consistency." You have bad days. AI doesn't. You get fatigued after reading 100 scans. AI doesn't. You sometimes miss things at 4pm on a Friday. AI reads scan #10,000 the same as scan #1.

Radiologists become AI Scan Reviewers who:

- **Confirm or override AI reads**: The AI flagged it, but is it really cancer or just an artifact?
- **Handle complex, ambiguous cases**: AI excels at pattern matching. You excel at "this doesn't fit any pattern."
- **Correlate with clinical context**: The scan shows something, but does it matter given this specific patient's history?
- **Communicate findings to other doctors**: AI generates a report. You call the surgeon and say "you need to see this now."
- **Perform procedures**: Image-guided biopsies and interventions still need human hands

## What Should Humans Do?

**Embrace AI as your co-reader.** Two readers are better than one. Think of AI as an always-available colleague who never gets tired and has seen millions of cases.

**Shift toward interventional radiology.** Procedures require physical dexterity and real-time judgment that AI can't replicate. This is the most AI-resistant part of radiology.

**Develop sub-specialty expertise.** The generalist radiologist reading everything is most vulnerable. Deep expertise in neuroradiology, MSK, or cardiac imaging keeps you ahead of AI's generalist capabilities.

**Focus on clinical integration.** Be the radiologist who attends tumor boards, consults with clinicians, and adds context that a standalone AI report can't. Be part of the care team, not just a report generator.

**Learn about AI validation and quality.** Understanding how AI models work, their failure modes, and how to audit their performance is a new but essential skill.

**Stay calm about the timeline.** AI has been "about to replace radiologists" for a decade. The reality is more nuanced. But do adapt—complacency is the real risk.
