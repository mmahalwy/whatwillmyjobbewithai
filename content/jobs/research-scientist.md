## Why This Job Will Transform

AI is accelerating research by automating literature reviews, generating hypotheses, and even writing code for experiments. The mechanical aspects of research are being automated while the creative and strategic aspects remain human.

Research scientists become Research Directors who guide research programs:

- **Research strategy**: Identifying promising research directions and allocating resources
- **Hypothesis generation**: Combining domain knowledge with AI capabilities to generate novel ideas
- **Experiment design**: Designing studies that produce reliable, meaningful results
- **Research communication**: Translating findings for different audiences and driving adoption
- **Team and AI orchestration**: Directing both human researchers and AI tools toward research goals

Research Directors amplify research impact through strategic direction and effective use of AI assistance.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Learn to use AI for research.** Familiarize yourself with tools for literature review, hypothesis generation, and automated experimentation. These tools amplify your research capacity.

**Develop research taste.** The ability to identify important problems and promising approaches becomes more valuable as execution becomes faster.

**Build communication skills.** Translating research for practitioners, executives, and the public maximizes the impact of your work.

**Cultivate interdisciplinary knowledge.** Novel research often happens at the intersection of fields. Broad knowledge helps you identify unexpected connections.

**Master experimental design.** Rigorous methodology ensures research produces reliable results, which becomes more important as AI enables more experiments.

**Build collaborative skills.** Research increasingly happens in teams. The ability to collaborate across disciplines and with AI systems expands what you can accomplish.
