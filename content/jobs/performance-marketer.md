## Why This Job Will Transform

Performance marketers manage paid advertising—creating campaigns, optimizing bids, and analyzing results. AI tools can now optimize campaigns automatically, generate ad variations, and even allocate budgets.

Performance marketers become Growth Strategists who:

- **Define growth strategy**: Determining how paid marketing fits into overall growth
- **Identify new channels**: Finding and testing emerging advertising opportunities
- **Optimize the full funnel**: Looking beyond ads to the entire customer journey
- **Build measurement frameworks**: Creating attribution models that capture true impact
- **Integrate with product**: Connecting marketing efforts with product-led growth

Growth Strategists think about growth holistically, not just paid channel management.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop strategic growth skills.** Understanding growth levers beyond paid ads expands your impact.

**Master measurement and attribution.** As AI handles execution, the ability to measure and optimize for true value becomes essential.

**Learn about product-led growth.** Understanding how product and marketing work together opens new growth opportunities.

**Build experimentation skills.** Running rigorous growth experiments across channels generates insights AI cannot provide.

**Understand unit economics.** Connecting marketing spend to customer lifetime value helps make better decisions.

**Stay current on privacy changes.** Evolving privacy regulations affect targeting and measurement. Understanding these changes is essential.
