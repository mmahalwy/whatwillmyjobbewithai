## Why This Job Will Transform

You spent three years in law school, passed the bar, and billed $500/hour to read documents. Impressive—AI can now read those same documents in seconds and it doesn't even need coffee or a corner office.

The bread and butter of legal work—contract review, legal research, due diligence, document drafting—is being devoured by AI tools that can process thousands of pages faster than you can say "billable hours." That memo you spent all weekend writing? Claude can draft it during the time it takes your Keurig to brew.

But here's the thing: lawyers aren't going away. The title stays. The prestige stays. What changes is everything underneath. The law is fundamentally about judgment, persuasion, and navigating ambiguity—things AI is spectacularly bad at. AI can find every relevant case in seconds, but it can't look a jury in the eye or know when to bluff in a negotiation.

Lawyers in the AI era will:

- **Use AI as a research associate that never sleeps**: Your first-year associates just got a lot less useful
- **Review AI-generated contracts**: Instead of drafting from scratch, you're editing AI output and catching hallucinated clauses
- **Focus on strategy and judgment**: The "thinking like a lawyer" part that law school promised was the point
- **Bill differently**: "I spent 40 hours on this" becomes harder to justify when clients know AI exists
- **Actually talk to clients**: With the grunt work automated, the human relationship becomes the product

The billable hour model is in trouble, but lawyers who adapt will thrive. The ones who don't will discover that their $200K law degree has the same ROI as a liberal arts degree.

## What Should Humans Do?

**Become a strategist, not a researcher.** AI handles the "what does the law say?" part. You handle the "what should we do about it?" part. That's where the real value lives.

**Develop negotiation and courtroom skills.** AI can draft the brief, but it can't read the room, adjust strategy mid-trial, or intimidate opposing counsel with a well-timed silence.

**Learn to use AI tools aggressively.** The lawyers who adopt AI early will eat the lunch of those who don't. A solo practitioner with good AI tools can now compete with a mid-size firm.

**Specialize deeply.** Generalist legal work is most vulnerable. If you're the world's foremost expert in semiconductor patent law, AI is your assistant, not your replacement.

**Rethink your billing model.** Value-based billing will replace hourly billing whether you like it or not. Get ahead of it.

**Build trust.** Clients hire lawyers they trust with their most important problems. AI has no reputation, no relationships, and no accountability. You do.
