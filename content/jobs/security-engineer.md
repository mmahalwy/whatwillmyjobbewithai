## Why This Job Will Transform

Security engineers implement security controls, respond to alerts, and manage security tools. AI can now detect threats, generate security configurations, and even respond to common incidents automatically.

Security engineers become Security Architects who:

- **Design security architectures**: Creating comprehensive security frameworks for complex systems
- **Assess emerging threats**: Understanding new attack vectors, including AI-powered threats
- **Build security into AI systems**: Ensuring AI applications are secure by design
- **Define security strategy**: Balancing security with usability and business needs
- **Guide security programs**: Directing security investments and priorities

Security Architects focus on strategy and architecture, using AI to handle operational security tasks.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop architectural thinking.** Understanding how to design secure systems from the ground up is essential.

**Learn about AI security.** Both securing AI systems and defending against AI-powered attacks are emerging areas.

**Build threat modeling skills.** The ability to systematically identify and prioritize threats helps design effective controls.

**Master security governance.** Understanding compliance frameworks, risk management, and security metrics is valuable.

**Stay current on threats.** The threat landscape evolves constantly. Continuous learning about new attacks and defenses is essential.

**Develop communication skills.** Translating security risks for non-technical stakeholders helps get support for security investments.
