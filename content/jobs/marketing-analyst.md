## Why This Job Will Transform

Marketing analysts create reports, track campaign performance, and analyze marketing data. AI can now generate these reports, identify trends, and even suggest optimizations.

Marketing analysts become Marketing Scientists who:

- **Design measurement frameworks**: Creating systems that capture true marketing impact
- **Solve attribution challenges**: Understanding how different touchpoints contribute to conversions
- **Run marketing experiments**: Designing tests that generate reliable insights
- **Model customer behavior**: Building predictive models for targeting and personalization
- **Connect marketing to business outcomes**: Demonstrating marketing's contribution to revenue and growth

Marketing Scientists apply scientific rigor to marketing measurement.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Understand privacy-preserving measurement.** As cookies disappear, new measurement approaches become essential.

**Develop experimentation expertise.** Designing rigorous marketing experiments generates insights that inform strategy.
