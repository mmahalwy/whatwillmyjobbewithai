## Why This Job Will Transform

Analytics engineers build the transformation layer that makes data usable—dbt models, data marts, and semantic layers. AI tools can now generate many of these transformations from descriptions of business logic.

Analytics engineers become Insights Architects who design how organizations understand themselves:

- **Semantic layer design**: Building business logic layers that multiple AI tools can query
- **Metrics governance**: Defining canonical metrics and ensuring consistency across tools
- **Self-service enablement**: Creating systems where stakeholders can answer questions without technical help
- **Data storytelling infrastructure**: Building the foundations for automated reporting and insights
- **AI-ready analytics**: Ensuring analytical assets work well with LLMs and AI applications

Insights Architects shape how data becomes understanding across the organization.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Master semantic layers.** Tools like dbt Semantic Layer, Cube, and LookML define how business concepts map to data. Deep expertise in these technologies is increasingly valuable.

**Understand LLM integration.** As natural language interfaces to data grow, understanding how to structure data and metadata for AI consumption becomes essential.

**Build documentation skills.** Clear documentation of business logic, metrics definitions, and data lineage is crucial for both human users and AI tools.

**Learn about data products.** Thinking of analytical assets as products with users, SLAs, and quality standards changes how you approach the work.

**Develop testing practices.** Data testing, assertions, and quality monitoring ensure analytical outputs are reliable as complexity grows.

**Understand performance optimization.** As data volumes grow, knowing how to optimize queries, manage costs, and design for scale remains important.
