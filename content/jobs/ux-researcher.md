## Why This Job Will Transform

UX researchers conduct user interviews, usability tests, and surveys. AI can now analyze interview transcripts, synthesize feedback, and even conduct automated user testing.

UX researchers become Behavioral Scientists who:

- **Design research programs**: Creating comprehensive research strategies that inform product direction
- **Uncover deep insights**: Finding the non-obvious insights that require human interpretation
- **Study AI-user interactions**: Understanding how users behave with AI-powered products
- **Build research operations**: Creating systems that scale research across organizations
- **Influence strategy**: Translating research into strategic decisions, not just tactical improvements

Behavioral Scientists apply scientific rigor to understanding human behavior in digital products.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Study behavioral science.** Learn about cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and research methodology. This foundation elevates your work above basic UX research.

**Develop quantitative skills.** Combining qualitative insights with quantitative data makes your research more compelling and actionable.

**Learn to study AI interactions.** Understanding how to research conversational UIs, AI recommendations, and human-AI collaboration is essential.

**Build research operations skills.** Creating systems that let non-researchers conduct basic research expands your impact.

**Master insight synthesis.** The ability to find patterns across research and articulate compelling insights is uniquely human and highly valuable.

**Develop executive communication skills.** Translating research into language that resonates with decision-makers increases the impact of your work.
