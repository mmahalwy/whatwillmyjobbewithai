## Why This Job Will Transform

Content writers produce articles, blog posts, and marketing copy. AI can now generate first drafts that are often good enough for many purposes, though they lack depth and original insight.

Content writers become Editorial Strategists who:

- **Define editorial direction**: Deciding what topics and angles to pursue
- **Bring unique perspectives**: Adding insights, opinions, and expertise AI cannot generate
- **Ensure quality and accuracy**: Editing and fact-checking AI-generated content
- **Build editorial systems**: Creating processes for content production at scale
- **Develop subject matter expertise**: Building deep knowledge that informs content strategy

Editorial Strategists focus on direction, quality, and differentiation rather than production.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop expertise in specific domains.** Deep subject matter knowledge creates content that AI cannot replicate.

**Master editing and quality control.** The ability to improve and verify AI-generated content is valuable.

**Build strategic thinking skills.** Understanding how content serves business goals elevates your work.

**Learn content operations.** Creating systems for efficient content production at scale maximizes your impact.

**Develop original perspectives.** Cultivate unique viewpoints and insights that differentiate your content.

**Understand content distribution.** Knowing how to get content in front of the right audiences complements creation skills.
