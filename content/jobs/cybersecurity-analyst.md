## Why This Job Will Transform

Cybersecurity analysts monitor security alerts, investigate incidents, and hunt for threats. AI tools can now triage alerts, correlate events, and even investigate common incident types.

Cybersecurity analysts become Threat Strategists who:

- **Understand adversaries**: Developing deep knowledge of threat actors and their techniques
- **Hunt sophisticated threats**: Finding advanced attacks that evade automated detection
- **Build detection strategies**: Designing detection approaches for emerging threats
- **Respond to complex incidents**: Leading investigation and response for major security events
- **Inform security architecture**: Translating threat intelligence into defensive improvements

Threat Strategists focus on the most sophisticated threats that require human intelligence.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop threat intelligence skills.** Understanding adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) helps you anticipate and detect attacks.

**Master incident response.** Leading complex incident investigations requires skills that go beyond following playbooks.

**Learn threat hunting techniques.** Proactively finding threats that bypass automated detection is increasingly valuable.

**Build forensics capabilities.** Deep investigation skills help understand what happened during sophisticated attacks.

**Understand AI in security.** Both AI-powered defenses and AI-enabled attacks are areas requiring expertise.

**Develop communication skills.** Explaining threats and incidents to executives and other stakeholders is essential for driving action.
