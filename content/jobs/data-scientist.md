## Why This Job Will Transform

Much of traditional data science—exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning—can now be automated by AutoML and AI tools. The barrier to building a working model has dropped dramatically.

Data scientists become Model Strategists who focus on the strategic aspects of ML:

- **Problem framing**: Identifying which problems are worth solving with ML and which aren't
- **Model selection at the system level**: Choosing between custom models, foundation models, and rule-based approaches
- **Evaluation strategy**: Defining what success looks like and how to measure it in production
- **Responsible AI**: Ensuring models are fair, interpretable, and aligned with organizational values
- **ML product thinking**: Understanding how models fit into products and user experiences

Model Strategists ensure ML investments actually create value, not just impressive accuracy numbers.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Learn MLOps and production ML.** Understanding how models behave in production—monitoring, retraining, A/B testing—is increasingly valuable as more models get deployed.

**Develop expertise in foundation models.** Understanding when to fine-tune vs. prompt, how to evaluate LLM outputs, and how to build applications on top of large models is essential.

**Build business acumen.** Connecting model performance to business outcomes helps you prioritize work and communicate value to stakeholders.

**Master responsible AI practices.** Fairness, interpretability, and safety are growing concerns. Expertise in identifying and mitigating model risks is increasingly important.

**Learn to work with unstructured data.** Text, images, and audio are where many interesting ML applications are. Experience with these data types expands your impact.

**Understand the economics of ML.** Knowing the costs of training, inference, and maintenance helps make better decisions about when ML is the right solution.
