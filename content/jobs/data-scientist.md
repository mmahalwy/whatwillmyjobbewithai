## Why This Job Will Transform

Remember when "Data Scientist" was the sexiest job of the 21st century? Well, it's 2024 and turns out that job mostly involved cleaning data in Jupyter notebooks while pretending to do "machine learning." Now AI can do that too—and it doesn't need a PhD.

Much of traditional data science—exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning—can now be done by literally anyone who can upload a CSV and type "find insights." Your carefully crafted XGBoost pipeline? Claude can write that in 30 seconds while also explaining it to your non-technical stakeholder.

The "unicorn" data scientist who knows statistics, coding, AND business? Turns out that unicorn was just three AI tools in a trench coat.

Data scientists become That Guy Who Asks Claude to Analyze CSVs:

- **Uploading files**: Dragging and dropping datasets into AI chat windows
- **Prompt crafting**: Typing "find the insights" and hoping for the best
- **Taking credit**: "My analysis shows..." (your analysis = Claude's analysis)
- **Explaining AI outputs**: Reading Claude's explanation back to stakeholders, but slower
- **Defending your job**: "AI can't do what I do" (narrator: it could)

## What Should Humans Do?

**Accept the new hierarchy.** You're not the wizard anymore. You're the wizard's assistant who fetches the data and formats the PowerPoint.

**Learn to ask good questions.** The one thing AI can't do (yet) is figure out what questions to ask. Be the person who knows what matters. This is genuinely valuable.

**Develop "AI Output Skepticism."** AI will confidently give you wrong answers with perfect grammar. Someone needs to catch this. Might as well be you.

**Get really good at storytelling.** AI can find insights. It cannot (yet) sit in a meeting and read the room while presenting those insights. Your soft skills matter more than ever.

**Pivot to ML Engineering.** The people deploying and maintaining ML systems in production are less replaceable than the people building models in notebooks. Consider the switch.

**Update your title to "AI/ML Specialist."** Same job, buzzier title, better job security. This is only slightly sarcastic advice.
