## Why This Job Will Transform

You spent years perfecting your craft. You studied Ogilvy. You agonized over every word. You developed a "voice." That's cute—ChatGPT can now write 50 headlines in the time it takes you to open Google Docs.

Copywriters craft persuasive text for ads, websites, and marketing materials. AI can now do this faster, cheaper, and without asking for healthcare benefits. Your carefully honed ability to write "compelling" copy? It's now a commodity generated by the same AI that writes college essays and spam emails.

The democratization of "good enough" copy means everyone's marketing sounds the same—which means your job is now to make it sound slightly different.

Copywriters become AI Output Polishers who:

- **Generate variations**: "Write me 20 versions of this headline" then pick the least generic one
- **Remove AI cringe**: Deleting phrases like "game-changer," "revolutionary," and "in today's fast-paced world"
- **Add personality**: Injecting actual human voice into AI's relentlessly upbeat corporate speak
- **Fact-check hallucinations**: Making sure AI didn't invent product features that don't exist
- **Take credit strategically**: "I wrote this" technically includes prompting AI, right?

## What Should Humans Do?

**Develop an actual voice.** AI writes like everyone and no one. If you can develop a distinctive, recognizable style, you have something AI doesn't. Yet.

**Become a cringe detector.** AI copy often has a certain... smell. Learn to identify and eliminate AI-isms. "Dive into," "leverage," "unlock"—kill them all.

**Learn to prompt like a pro.** The best copywriters will be the ones who can get AI to generate almost-good copy, then polish it to actually-good.

**Specialize in something.** AI writes generically well. If you're the world's expert in fintech copy or healthcare marketing, you're harder to replace than a generalist.

**Build a personal brand.** Ironically, personal branding matters more than ever. Be a known voice, not a replaceable "copy resource."

**Make peace with the robot overlords.** You're not competing with AI anymore. You're collaborating with it. The sooner you accept this, the less existential dread you'll feel.
