## Why This Job Will Transform

Full stack developers have always been generalists—comfortable working across the entire application. With AI handling more of the implementation details on both frontend and backend, the full stack developer's breadth becomes their greatest asset.

The role evolves into Product Engineer, someone who:

- **Owns features end-to-end**: Takes a product idea from conception to deployed, monitored production code
- **Makes product decisions**: Chooses what to build and what to skip based on user impact and technical feasibility
- **Moves fast with AI assistance**: Uses AI tools across the stack to ship features that previously required multiple specialists
- **Balances trade-offs holistically**: Understands how frontend choices affect backend load, how database design affects user experience
- **Bridges technical and business**: Translates user needs into technical solutions without waiting for detailed specifications

Product Engineers are force multipliers. They can take vague product requirements and deliver working software, using AI to fill in the implementation gaps.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop strong product intuition.** Follow product leaders on Twitter, read product-focused blogs, and study how successful companies make decisions. Understanding why to build something becomes more valuable than knowing how.

**Learn to ship incrementally.** The best Product Engineers ship small, get feedback, and iterate. Practice breaking large features into tiny, deployable pieces that provide value immediately.

**Build your own products.** Side projects where you make all the decisions—product, design, and technical—build the muscle for end-to-end ownership. Ship something real, even if it's small.

**Get comfortable with ambiguity.** Product Engineers often work with incomplete information. Practice making good decisions with limited data and adjusting as you learn more.

**Master AI-assisted development.** Since you work across the stack, you need to be proficient with AI tools for every layer. Learn which tools work best for frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure work.

**Understand metrics and analytics.** Knowing how to measure the impact of your work helps you prioritize and make better product decisions. Learn about A/B testing, cohort analysis, and key business metrics.
