## Why This Job Will Transform

You pull 100-hour weeks building financial models, crafting pitch books, and subsisting on a diet of Seamless orders and anxiety. You can build a DCF in your sleep—which is good, because you don't sleep. Here's the thing: AI can now build that same DCF in 30 seconds, and it doesn't need a $150K base salary to do it.

The analytical grunt work of investment banking—financial modeling, comparable company analysis, precedent transactions, and pitch book creation—is being automated at a pace that should terrify every first-year analyst. AI can process financial data, generate valuations, and produce presentation-ready output without a single all-nighter.

But investment banking was never really about the models. It was about the relationships, the deal-making, and convincing a CEO to sell their company at 3am over scotch. AI can't do that. Yet.

The title stays because the prestige industrial complex demands it, but the job transforms:

- **Deals still need dealmakers**: AI can value a company, but it can't convince a founder to sell
- **Models become commodities**: Your edge isn't building the model—it's knowing which assumptions to use
- **Junior roles shrink dramatically**: The analyst class that did the modeling is being replaced by AI
- **Senior bankers become more productive**: One MD with AI tools does what an MD plus four analysts used to
- **Due diligence goes hyperspeed**: AI can review a data room in hours, not weeks

## What Should Humans Do?

**Skip to the relationship part faster.** The traditional path of "grind for 2 years doing models, then maybe talk to clients" is collapsing. Develop client skills earlier.

**Become a judgment machine.** AI can produce 10 different valuations. You need to know which one is right, which assumptions are garbage, and what the market will actually bear.

**Specialize in complex situations.** Vanilla M&A advisory is getting commoditized. Distressed debt, cross-border deals, and hostile takeovers still need human creativity and nerves of steel.

**Develop sector expertise.** The banker who deeply understands fintech or biotech valuations is harder to replace than the generalist who can model anything but understands nothing.

**Rethink the analyst pipeline.** If you're considering IB as a career, know that the entry-level path is changing. The skills that get you in the door are shifting from "Excel wizard" to "AI-augmented deal advisor."

**Maintain your network.** Your Rolodex (or LinkedIn connections, for the younger crowd) is your most valuable asset. AI doesn't have relationships. You do.
