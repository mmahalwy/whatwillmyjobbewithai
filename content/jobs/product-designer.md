## Why This Job Will Transform

Product designers create user interfaces, design systems, and user flows. AI tools can now generate UI designs, create prototypes from descriptions, and iterate on designs based on feedback.

Product designers become Experience Strategists who:

- **Define experience strategy**: Determining what the overall product experience should feel like
- **Design for AI interactions**: Creating experiences where AI and humans collaborate naturally
- **Shape brand through design**: Ensuring design expresses and reinforces brand values
- **Lead design systems**: Creating and evolving systems that maintain consistency at scale
- **Validate with users**: Conducting research that informs design direction

Experience Strategists focus on the strategic and human aspects of design that AI cannot replicate.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Study human psychology.** Understanding cognitive biases, mental models, and behavior helps you design experiences that work with human nature.

**Learn about AI interfaces.** Chat interfaces, generative UI, and AI-assisted interactions are new paradigms. Understanding how to design for them is essential.

**Develop design systems expertise.** As AI generates more designs, maintaining consistency through systems becomes more important.

**Build research skills.** User research that informs strategy is more valuable than research that validates specific designs.

**Master storytelling and presentation.** The ability to present and sell design concepts to stakeholders becomes more important as design becomes more strategic.

**Understand business strategy.** Design Strategists need to connect design decisions to business outcomes. Understanding business models and metrics is essential.
