## Why This Job Will Transform

UI designers create visual designs for interfaces—colors, typography, icons, and layouts. AI tools can now generate visual designs from descriptions and even iterate based on feedback.

UI designers become Visual Systems Designers who:

- **Create visual languages**: Developing cohesive visual systems that express brand and guide interaction
- **Design for consistency at scale**: Building systems that maintain quality as products grow
- **Direct AI-generated designs**: Guiding AI tools toward appropriate visual solutions
- **Define aesthetic principles**: Establishing taste and standards that AI can learn from
- **Innovate visual experiences**: Creating new visual approaches that differentiate products

Visual Systems Designers focus on the principles and systems that guide visual design, not individual screens.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Develop strong visual taste.** Study typography, color theory, and visual hierarchy deeply. This foundation helps you evaluate and improve AI-generated designs.

**Master design systems.** Building and maintaining design systems that work at scale is essential as AI generates more designs.

**Learn motion and animation principles.** Motion design adds dimension to static designs and requires understanding timing and physics that AI handles less well.

**Build brand design skills.** Understanding how visual design expresses and reinforces brand helps you make strategic visual decisions.

**Study design history.** Understanding design movements and their contexts helps you innovate while remaining grounded in proven principles.

**Develop art direction skills.** The ability to direct and critique visual work—whether human or AI-generated—becomes essential.
