## Why This Job Will Transform

Design systems engineers build and maintain component libraries and design tokens. AI can now generate components and even suggest design system improvements.

Design systems engineers become Design Infrastructure Leads who:

- **Architect design platforms**: Creating infrastructure that supports design at scale
- **Enable AI design tools**: Building systems that AI tools can leverage for consistent design
- **Drive adoption**: Ensuring design systems are actually used and provide value
- **Govern design quality**: Establishing standards and processes that maintain quality
- **Future-proof systems**: Making architectural decisions that accommodate emerging tools and needs

Design Infrastructure Leads build the foundations that enable consistent, scalable design.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Understand AI design tools deeply.** Knowing how AI design tools work helps you build systems that integrate well with them.

**Build developer experience skills.** Design systems are tools for developers. Understanding DX helps you create systems people want to use.

**Learn about design tokens and theming.** Understanding how to create flexible, token-based systems enables customization while maintaining consistency.

**Master documentation and communication.** Design systems succeed through adoption, which requires excellent documentation and communication.

**Develop governance frameworks.** Creating processes for contribution, review, and evolution of design systems is essential for long-term success.

**Build performance expertise.** Understanding component performance helps you create systems that work well in production.
