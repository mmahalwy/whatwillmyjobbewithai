## Why This Job Will Transform

Traditional ML engineering—building training pipelines, feature stores, and model serving infrastructure—is becoming more standardized. Meanwhile, foundation models are changing what ML engineers need to build.

ML engineers become Foundation Model Engineers who:

- **Adapt foundation models**: Fine-tuning, RAG, and prompt engineering to make large models work for specific applications
- **Build AI applications**: Creating end-to-end systems that combine models with traditional software
- **Optimize for cost and latency**: Making AI applications practical at scale through optimization and efficient deployment
- **Integrate AI safely**: Building guardrails, content filters, and monitoring for AI systems
- **Evaluate AI systems**: Developing evaluation frameworks for generative and agentic AI

Foundation Model Engineers work at the frontier of making powerful AI models useful in real applications.

## What You Can Do to Get Ahead

**Master prompt engineering and RAG.** These techniques are fundamental to building applications on foundation models. Understand embedding models, vector databases, and retrieval strategies.

**Learn model optimization.** Techniques like quantization, distillation, and speculative decoding help make AI affordable at scale.

**Build expertise in evaluation.** Evaluating LLM outputs requires different approaches than traditional ML. Learn about LLM-as-judge, human evaluation protocols, and benchmark design.

**Understand multi-modal AI.** Models that work with text, images, audio, and video are becoming more capable. Experience with multi-modal applications is valuable.

**Learn about AI agents.** Understanding how to build reliable AI agents that can take actions, use tools, and work autonomously is an emerging skill.

**Stay current on foundation model developments.** The field moves fast. Following research, understanding new model capabilities, and evaluating new approaches is essential.
